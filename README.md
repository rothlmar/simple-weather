#Overview:

Create a single page JavaScript application to browse the weather for three major US cities (Austin, LA, & DC).
See the services folder for stub JSON data to use for the weather.

##Business Requirements:
- The user can see an overview of all three cities (Austin, LA, DC) with their current temperature.
- The user can click on a city to see a detail screen with information about that city (humidity, dew point, etc).
- The user can bookmark any cityâ€™s details in their browser.
- The user can access the site using modern versions IE, Firefox or Chrome.

##Technical Requirements:
- Should be implemented as a "single-page" JavaScript application.
- Should be covered with automated tests.
- Should consume the supplied JSON files as if they were service calls (using XHR).
- Should build the app in an extensible manner for future features

##Things we value (non-functional requirements):
- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Clarity

##Submitting
---------------------------

Commit your files along with an estimation of the amount of time it
took you to complete the test. If you could not complete parts of the test,
include an explanation of what parts and why.
Small incremental commits are preferred over one large commit so we can see how you work.
